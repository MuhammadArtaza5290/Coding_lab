// 1. Problem: Write a Python program to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is based on the following conditions:

// If the price is greater than $500, apply a 20% discount.
// If the price is between $300 and $500, apply a 15% discount.
// If the price is between $100 and $300, apply a 10% discount.
// If the price is less than $100, no discount is applied.
// If the customer is a member, an additional 5% discount is applied after the initial discount.


  let price = prompt("Enter a price:");
  let member = prompt("You are our member?");
  if (price > 5000) {
    percentage = 20/100 *price;
    price = price - percentage;
    console.log(`Your total price is ${price}.`);

        price = price - percentage1;

// Is divisible by 4.
// But if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.
